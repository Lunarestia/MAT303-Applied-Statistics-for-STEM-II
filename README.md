# CODED IN R

Problem sets and Projects done in my MAT-303 Applied Statistics for STEM II course at SNHU

Every project and problem set is coded in R. It says HTML because the visual file included for each problem set or project is an HTML file. I have included the .r files as well so they can be opened in Rstudio or whatever R environment you use.
